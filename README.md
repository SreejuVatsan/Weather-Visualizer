# Weather-Visualizer
A real-time, interactive weather visualizer aimed at visualizing the complex weather data in a simple and straightforward way, just like in a weather widget. This project is directly inspired by ['earth'](https://earth.nullschool.net/), a project that visualizes the global weather conditions and ['MeteoEarth'](http://www.meteoearth.com/), an interactive global comprehensive 3D weather forecasts.
